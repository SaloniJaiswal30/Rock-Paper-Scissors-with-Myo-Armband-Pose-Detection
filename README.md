# Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Myo-Armband-Pose-Detection(GAMYO)
This is a game based project using Myo. This game has 2 ways to play one with hand gesture and another with voice command (for physically challenged people).This detects the poses of userâ€™s hand using Myo , it also recognizes the voice and gives the winner of the game.
## Technolgies Used
- Python3
- MYO
- Machine Learning
- pygame
## Description
This can be implemented using pose identifed by myo or by making a data set for 3 hand gestures(Rock, paper and scissors) and predict using machine learning models. 
- Dataset has been made using train_gesture.py(required Myo in hand). Testdata prediction and model pridiction has been done using test_gesture.py. 
- Pose identification using MYO and voice identification using google api has been done with full UI using RPSgame.py
### Installation
- Unzip the MYO library files.
- install MYO, sklearn on python
